# Deep Learning Network Intrusion Detection System

This repository contains an implementation of a deep learning model, trained on the CIC-IDS-2018 dataset, which is available on the Kaggle website. 

## General information

The created architecture of the deep neural network (DNN) is evaluated with various metrics, with an emphasis on speed, or accuracy. 
The dataset is pre-processed, so that the intrusion detection system can operate with less computational cost. 
The testing of results is divided, so that the result either points to the network flow being part of an attack, or not.

## Considerations

This was my first attempt at traing a machine learning model, it is by no means perfect, or even accurate.
It is most likely very outdated, but it will not be maintained.
