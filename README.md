# Deep Learning Network Intrusion Detection System

<p> Thesis, made for the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in the year 2022/2023 </p>

## Abstract

<p> The widespread use of interconnected computer systems has become the foundation of improving our lives. At the same time it highlighted the vulnerabilities, that can be exploited to overcome human control. Because of these vulnerabilities, security systems in the field of cyber security are essential, for secure communication between networks. One of the mechanisms that allow us to defend against network attacks are intrusion detection systems (IDS).</p>

<p> In this paper I explore the applicability and performance of deep learning algorithms in the field of knowledge of network intrusions, given the expected acceleration and increase in computer threats.</p>

<p> The paper describes the implementation of a deep learning model, trained on the CIC-IDS-2018 dataset, which is available on the Kaggle website. The created architecture of the deep neural network (DNN) is evaluated with various metrics, with an emphasis on speed, or accuracy. The dataset is pre-processed, so that the intrusion detection system can operate with less computational cost. The testing of results is divided, so that the result either points to the network flow being part of an attack, or not.</p>
